002_test        inheritance of structs      Víctor Loeches      03-nov-22           PENDING, tested with the version which solves the test.

                                                                                          Current test is sending and receiving several messages of differents structs oh the same module.
                                                                                          Jorge will investigate how to use inheritance in cyclonedds-python.
