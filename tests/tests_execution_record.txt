002_test        inheritance of structs      Víctor Loeches      03-nov-22           PENDING, tested with the version which solves the test.
                without any keyword                                                 NOTE: We have seen in the Python code generated that inheritance is implemented.
                                                                                          Current test is sending and receiving several messages of differents structs oh the same module.
                                                                                          Jorge will investigate how to use inheritance in cyclonedds-python.
